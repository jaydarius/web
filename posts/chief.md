The call of novelty is irresistable to players in touch with the spirit of the times.

It is evident in my life. Any subject which has extraordinary sophistication will require me to appoint myself of chief investigator of this question:  How has this subject arrived to such a high level? So, these novelties are investigated with gusto. Every droplet of information assimilated into my sea of knowledge.

However, it is human to behold the sea as great and terrible. You fear the power of the tide when called upon to access it for your scoiety. One trick is organizing the dam within. This is done daily: your speech uses a silent filtering mechanism to translate the nebulous into the concise. Engineering may be another word for this.

Such is this organization of novelty-apprehension for contributions to your society. They differ per field. You may not be able to organize a dam; your filter may be rock or two because of that great power. This is what we tend to call "actions of pure emotion."

Emotion comfotably resides in poetry. It can be interepreted as a chaotic or a sophistiacted structure to anyone outside the author's mind. Poetry itself is a medium for communities to organize around when interpretations are agreed upon. This contribution can be the necessary novelty to increase one's skill in the game of life.

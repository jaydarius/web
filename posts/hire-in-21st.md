As always, in the eyes of the company, the customer's struggle is viewed as fertile land of opportunity. The company's solution is that which can sustainably improve the land.

And as always, the competitors' tools must be stopped from reaching said land. While many methods include marketing and government regulating.  I'll talk about the employment of mercenaries (i.e. the modern employee). We will mention their origins in war, then view their use in the marketplace.

In war, those for hire are seeking to employ combative skills in the name of a highest bidder. It is known they risk an instant death and will leave a struggle for their families. This raises the question: are they historically lower-class citizens who became combat specialists to leave (what is in their eyes) a terrible state? In the historian's eyes, "yes" seems to be the answer. But moving on: two reasons of many come to mind concerning their decision. One, those that the mercenary leaves behind will be in the care of a governing body. Two, the mercenary has the opportunity to reach great influence given they win the majority of their battles.

Modern company recruiting involves placing information in key sections of a geography. The latter is not merely two dimensional and covers the digital realm as well. While the company founders company generated the genuine product, they alone do not have the resources recruit the best. Hence, this novel idea - it's potential now manifest with investors' money along with initial sales - enables recruitment.

It is obvious that life is not at intense risk when in the employ of a modern company when compared to the likes of being in actual war. In fact, the perks and benefits enhance life by degrees of magnitude. The bloody battlefield is now translated to ideas being erased on whiteboards. This modern mercenary must still be loyal as ever to the company's vision and growth, but he must be mindful of the battlegrounds of the mind, notably nebulous decision making. One metric of winning an information battles is a product implementation. This 4th dimension: information warfare, is what the modern hire needs to apprehend and master to become a most valuable member of the company.

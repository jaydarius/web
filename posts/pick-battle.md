Knowing this is crucial to picking the battles. And pick we must, for each day brings bouts in which we are called; we win or lose. A hater will quickly resort to ad hominems and straw-manning, but a critic will apply his point to the strongest argument from the opponent. The hater will devour and engage with hearsay and secondary sources. The critic will contemplate the subject as a whole that is derived from the primary sources he must be familiar with.

This introduces a big problem for both parties. Primary sources can be difficult to understand - these are written many generations before us and make references that require further reading which involves vocabulary that involves further reading, etc, etc. This is where the guide (e.g. your university professor) comes to aid in the teaching environment. They are the bridge between that of the world ago and today's open minds. With this said, the hater refuses to find the guide and the critic is usually within the bounds of a guide. However, critics must not let the guide's experience absolutely crush the spirit of the times.

Snowkeys! And it lives among the office. Please don't expect this on the Chrome Store.

It was a journey that contained a very important lesson: no matter the program that seems small and light on the outside, it's source code must be highly sophisticated. So I had to slow it down. Read the Chrome API -- evaluate it and understand it. It was basically like reading a new book. I am pleased: this extension saves time on my mouse by adding hotkeys to areas of the specified page. It was well received.

P.S. I prefer Python's format and syntax exponentially to Javascript.

P.P.S. I am grateful for jQuery and Mousetrap

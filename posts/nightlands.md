# The Thrill of the Night Lands
Electrified saws cutting through spines! Hulking creatures with eyes unblinked for millions of years! The Last of Humanity living inside a metal pyramid!

No, this isn't your favorite deathcore band shredding it in audio nor the architected utopia of the Matrix; these scenes are in the haunting, mystifying, sobering stories of 20 million years into a future Earth appearing in _Awake In the Nightlands_ by John C. Wright. And though the menacing monsters seem all too powerful, our future selves, still bonded by family and love, march ahead under reason's inevitable progress. They fight and innovate in hope for a better tomorrow. For some Fate beckons daring men and women to walk the Night Lands outside their haven: be it to rescue a beloved or to discover the next location humanity that can aid in the possible restoration of Earth's sunlit days. Either way you are in for fantastic adventure. 

Consider these tall tales at your next circle 'round the fire. You can start off by telling your listeners to imagine an event that forever winked the sun out along with all the fellow stars of the known universe. Or try this dreadful line: since your birth you've never seen a sun rise or set. 

All you know are artificial lights. And with these, we are able to grow gardens, and even crops, hundreds of miles in the stratas under the ground. That is how you're fed; plus you can still grab an intoxicating sip, though at a ration, from some of the wineries. The day may consist of being such farmer or accepting the order of the Monstruwacan -- the Monster Watchers at the pyramid's pinnacle. Such is life inside the Last Redoubt, an armored mega-pyramid hosting the final millions of humanity. It's armor is also charged with electricity that shines upon the outside as a baby-Moon would should it ever sit in the midst of the earth.

And who roams these Night lands? The Abhuman, Strange, and Terrible. Besides those aforementioned Giant Watching Things, we have horse-sized wolves with scorpion tails, floating bells that pull the unlucky off the ground for total annihilation, and the Silent Ones who seem to be the masterminds of these Monstrous Enemies. These are the those that have destroyed the other galactic-systems when the human race used to be the Star Farers of mega-millenia ago. It's exclusive to this Earth of the entire universe where humane life exists.

In essence, this book reads like a Sci-Fi with it's psychics and advanced armaments, but you'll feel the kind of terror that is found within a classic Poe title.

Try this one out! This is my second go at diving into the author's tremendous imagination. The first was with the also amazing _City Beyond Time: Tales of the Fall of Metachronopolis_.

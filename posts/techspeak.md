A newly purchased product puts a strain on integrating it with others. This tends to be due to new terminology. As Tech Support, in my research of App A, I must redefine its components in the vocabulary of my company. These definitions can then be used with the end users and my company's engineers. Once resolved, this knowledge must be recorded for further App A support.

The notion of "techspeak", and becoming fluent in it, must be every one's prerogative in a company providing integrations with dozens of applications.

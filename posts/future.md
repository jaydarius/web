So you wanna write about the future?

The people: what have they learned? What have they forgotten? You remember WH40K as a great example of technologies learned then lost. Ah, but how does it happen? War.

Humans who war with each other and aliens who war with them. As in Nightlands, 4D creatures join the fray! 

It seems as you advance into the future, as a writer, you can cut millenia of progress because of conflict, destruction of knowledge, and the ignorance that follows. Ignorance can be willful on part of the suppressor and not so on part of the oppressed.

From You to You: what causes your knowledge to be stifled? Your own personal conflict. You may have learned a new way to adjust to a problem. But what followed was the Emotion of the Day, and you served that. Service to any bodily function is away from your Father, who imbued the You with an unshakeable sense of eternity.

Remember, because you can write about eternity, means you are made to return to that Level of Life.

From You to You, re: music... your plan is to name some published act, FREESTYLE.

Why does the future capture anyone's attention? Because it will have a level of progress, and novelty, that the people want. You do want to know the problems your descendants will face because you are in charge of today. So with this charge, you solve your problems. You see that Tomorrow's Human will benefit in some way. But they will face a new problem. This leads the Story of the Future to inevitably include to weapons, war, knowledge.

If today is full of conflict, then the progress of the future inevitably will carry that. Knowing God's laws about the sin of man is something all humans know. Yet many poor souls refuse to believe, but play the part. This is that society you live in. Many go CIA because they want to cultivate their own following so they can be worshipped.

So a novel idea in the future is the Forgetfulness of the Self such that worship literally charges the Future Demon-Gods. It has to be something that the worshiper does,daily, willingly (or so they think). 

## The Psychic Syndrome

This amazing, confounding ability: quite prescient in Foundation, Nightland, Dune, WH40K. 

One may say it'll be the highest form of communication. Today's innovations include a communication device that is always in your pocket: the Cell Phone. The developers of apps on that Phone deliver you faster ways to speak the same language: to post photos and videos more quickly. And the rise of the Emoji to convey many words with pictures needs not be overstated. 

But words and music have always been a way for us to signal each other tasks and emotions. In both mediums, the tools to start that phase can be cumbersome, painful, expensive to any one who dares to pick that up. Recall that the Ancients had scribes who were but less than 1% of the population that was literate. Today, musical instruments are still challenging to learn. 

Communication of violence is easy: look at the knife and its cousin sword. One action means damage. Both parties simply understand what has happened when a blow is delivered. A resolution of the tension is also immediate when a foe's heart stopped at its final beat.

But the communication by music is meant to part tensions at a slower rate and with less of a mortal impact. These tensions are always human. Music isn't as commanding as a word. The tension lifecycle caused by words is almost as instant as the violent approach. You use the word to influence someone from relieving the tension within you, them, or both.

The people dream of words to resolve faster. Our mouths can only move so fast and speak at such a high (or low when in Enemy Territory) enough volume. Mind-reading is the choice. To build a device that records the frequency which contains a thought captivates you. An application of this recorder is best seen in the Library Scene of Nightlands where one can read an Author's Thoughts as they also hear his voice say the words. 

The psychics bring conflict and resolution immediately. We go from simply reading minds to talking to them. Then the next step is violence. To control a mind with your own thoughts or flood someone with artificial Brain Waves. Imagine a gun that shot such wave rapidly. And your brain would perceive it and never think it was you. You then lose yourself. 

Thus, with such power, we must remember cost. The tentsion life-cycle, to be achieved at the fastest rate (under death) means that energy from some materials must be consumed: geography (ocean, trees, grass, sky), humans (cities, guilds), character (person's heart or soul or mind). 

For a human to read another thought is to achieve the goal in the future that is the same as the one today: give or get. Though Thought Recording, Bending, Flaying sounds fascinating.

You must understand the patterns of today's problems for an individual. Then apply the same pattern to that individual's city. Then State, Nation, Country, and World.

Many scifi introduce that the world unity is inevitable. Why?

Today: high-impact problems are brought by forces that aren't human. See natural disasters and diseases. We are not alone equipped to cause these problems. It's ethereal. But combine those ethereal forces together to make a civilization; this civilization combines efforts for a Defense system against another civ. Now you do have a high-impact problem from a human.

Future: problems are brought by forces that aren't human. Again, we refer to WH40K, with its Warp and Demons that drive the humans to do what they do. Oh, and what else? Besides 4D creatures, we have other races - Orks, Tau. It's implied, then, that another race can always, always have a non-human element to them. That's why they are Alien or Xeno.

It's thrilling for a reader to engage inside that Alien which is sooo similar to themself, but just that one quality, taken to an extreme, wholly sets the observer apart from this fictional race. Orks with their WAAAUGH banners, green skin, and thorough disgust for humans. They also enslave and breed lesser races. Imagine dogs could talk and build machinery with their paws. Just like those Gretchins. And you'd leave those Mega-Dogs alone, but guess what: the Warp has brought the Familiars out, and they hunt you. You and the Dogs agree that a partnership is valuable. They submit to you, during war, for the peace to come. Otherwise: death.

And so, in the future is death. Hence why it fascinates your dear readers. "People still die?" Yes. A story can't work if people always lived. And this is why no matter how far in the future you go, you must write about the cost of living in that timeframe. Anyone who has ever made a decision understands cost. Hence Immortal Elves and Men of Tolkien. You'd get bored of the Elves, but throw in the mortality of Men, and you observe conflict. The desire to have immortality on one hand, mortality on the other. Eternity is much closer to Elf than Human. But somehow, the intesity of Human art roars and sings past the Elf.

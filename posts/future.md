# The Stimulating Stories of Beyond the Present
So you wanna write about the future? Consider this fundamental stage...

Those advanced people have always learned some things and have forgotten others. 

Warhammer 40000 is a stellar example of technologies learned then lost in the deca-millenia of humanity. The destruction of their knowledge has its vehicle in war. This setting and many other future stories contain one binary condition of humanity within us today: the aggressor and the defender.  Sometimes the Future us gets over themselves and band together against aliens. Sometimes the aliens win, such as 4D creatures in Wright's Awake in the Nightlands. 

As a writer, you can cut millenia of progress because of conflict and the ignorance that follows. Ignorance can be willful on part of the suppressor and, as expected, not so on part of the oppressed. You can then create all types of fictional worlds that are slightly ignorant in one technology tree so you can mimic today in many ways. See Lucas' Star Wars galaxy is believable, with its anachronisms, because progress has been impeded in ma myriad of way; one of them through a charmingly bureacratic Empire.

As seen in the recently release high-production film, Tenet, stories of the future contain a level of progress, and novelty, that today's people want. We are keen on becoming conscious of the problems our descendants will face. And then we want to see how they can be solved. 

It is inevitable that a new solution will beget a new problem. The qualia of such declaration is time, soul, and death.

# The Psychic Syndrome
Science fiction presents Psychic Ability in believable ways: from Foundation's Magnifico to the Star Wars Jedi. What explains this trope?

You can start with the highest form of communication: mind-reading. Today's innovations include a communication device that is always in your pocket (you Cyborg!): the Cell Phone. The developers of apps on that Phone deliver faster ways to share your story. This is evident on the most popular apps in the world that service billions' feeds of photos and videos. And the rise of the Emoji to convey many words with pictures needs not be overstated. 

Words and music have always been a way for us to signal each other tasks and emotions. In both mediums, wielding the respecitve tools can be cumbersome, painful, expensive to any one who dares to pick that up. Recall that the Ancients had scribes who were but less than 1% of the literate population. Cast your gaze around the festivals of today and see musical instruments are still challenging to learn. At any rate, time must be consumed for a human to signal another.

Yet communication of violence is easy: look at the knife and its cousin sword. One swift action means damage; both parties intuitively understand what has happened. Is that charming Tension that resides in the Human Condition in your environment? Its resoution can be immediate when a foe's heart has stopped at its final beat. Contrast that with music: its meant to part tensions at a slower rate and with less of a mortal impact. But Music isn't as commanding as a Word. The tension lifecycle caused by words _is almost_ as instant as the violent approach. You use the Word to influence someone from relieving the tension within you, them, or both.

The Psychic Powers in our SciFi show that today's people dream of tension to resolve faster. Our mouths can only move so fast and speak at such a high (or low when in Enemy Territory) enough volume. Mind-reading is the next iteration of our communcation.  For example, it's not utterly improbable in our lifetime to build a device that records a thought by capturing its frequencies. An application of this recorder is best seen in the Library Scene of Nightlands where one can read an Author's Thoughts as they also hear his voice say the words. 

The Psychics, like their Old Earth Wizard counterparts, bring conflict and resolution immediately. As inevitable as this positive progress is, to read and talk to the mind, the Human Condition brings us to violence. A Man Thirsty for Power wants to control a mind; many stories gives us an understanding for such a villain. Thus, with such power, we must remember cost. The tension life-cycle, to be achieved at the fastest rate (outside of death) means that energy from some materials must be consumed including but not limited to: geography (ocean, trees, grass, sky), humans (cities, guilds), character (person's heart, soul, mind). 

# Goals of our Future Selves
For a human to read another thought is to achieve one fundamental goal in the future that is the same as today: to give or to get _something_. And our our action-packed SciFi never fails give us some of those examples of action that'll make us cringe or grin: Thought Recording, Bending, Flaying.

One achieved goal is that of Earth's unity. Say, a mega-empire is born through a weapon they wield over others, or a confederation is formed against a Xeno threat. Or maybe all consumer resources are generated by an Infinity Device. But ever present is a problem larger than the Unity of Men. This is brought forces that are beyond the individual. See natural disasters and diseases. Human's are not alone equipped to devastate populace in such a way. And so, in the future is death. Hence why it fascinates your dear readers. 

"People still die?" Yes. A story can't work if people always lived. And this is why no matter how far in the future you go, you must write about the cost of living in that timeframe. Anyone who has ever made a decision understands cost. Hence Immortal Elves and Mortal Men of Tolkien. You'd get bored of the Elves, but the popularity of Middle Earth resides in its axiom that mortality itself is a gift.

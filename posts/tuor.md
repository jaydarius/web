# Setting
Ulmo, the Arda's Guardian of the Waters, counseled the Mighty Elven King, Turgon, to leave the supposedly impregnable secret city of Gondolin for the West. For Morgoth himself and his servants located it through twisted manipulation of Iluvatar's children. It was Tuor, the human, who was Ulmo's messenger but Turgon was convinced by the jealous Maeglin to stay. 

Morgoth and his dragons and balrogs surprised the denizens of Gondolin and overtook it after fierce battle. A secret passage made by Tuor's beloved, Idril, unbeknownst to the Enemy, was used to facilitate safe passage for the remaining. 

The King lay dead after heroically slaying the Balrog Lord.

Enter Tuor to that scene...

# The Fall of Gondolin - Extended
Gothmog's smoldering body lay on Turgon. His golden javelin piercing through its back. Tuor pulled out his Silome from the Lesser Balrog and turned to the wretched hulk of its master. The feet of his King were sticking out from under it. Grief's pain raced through him as the thought of his Majesty's body  leaving this world. Tuor started toward the mass when he heard a woman's shriek. His. 
He glanced about, as Glorfindel appeared on the wall and pointed at the Fountain's Gate. "Maeglin goes!" Glorfindel cried and a mighty Orc descended upon him. But the Gate at the other end was destroyed by the dragons. Maeglin could only make for the battlements. Alone, Tuor ran.

Maeglin dragged the unconscious Idril with his mighty arm while brandishing his Hayendil in the other. Tuor caught up and was within paces and he saw madness in his fallen brother's eyes. Pity stirred in Tuor's soul for he saw the twisted servitude to Morgoth on that face.
"Maeglin!" exclaimed Tuor, "You must release yourself from this curse! Morgoth has deceived you!"
Maeglin brought his javelin to the fair face of Idril. She limply stirred. The cries of the battle on the other side of echoed up the wall's sheer face.  The night's glow revealed the smugness of this Dark Servant. 
"She put up a fight and I didn't wish to bruise her", Maeglin cried. "But here we are. Let us go!" Though his last word was but a croak. 
Tuor cooly said, "There's naught for you, Maeglin. You have destroyed our city... our king... but you can let her go and come with us." He lowered silome and started to Maeglin. 
Maeglin's back was against the ruined battlement among the broken stone. It was breached by dragon flame and balrog whip. He looked at the sky hoping for a dragon's aid. But when he saw Tuor move, he growled, "Hold your step- "
But those were the last words of Maeglin the Betrayer as Idril poured Isiband's Phial on Maeglin's arm; it fell limp at his side and he stumbled on the rubble. Idril moved to her beloved.

But Magelin's only arm couldn't catch himself as he slipped over the battlement. He fell down the sheer rock face of the High Walls of Gondolin. Idril and Tuor heard the three crunching thumps as his body rolled. They looked at each other knowing it finally rested at 300 feet below. They embraced.

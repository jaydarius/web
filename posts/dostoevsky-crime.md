In part two's scene at the Crystal Palace, we are witness to Rodya talking in a collected, civilized manner to an alarmed Zamyotov. But our protagonist's conversational approach is still tinged with derisive mockery referring to his acquaintance as "my littler sparrow." This sudden turn of character is astounding, and warrants further inspection into the author's genius execution of Rodya's development.

150 pages have passed where Dostoevsky presented Rodya from his livid state in festering in destitute living quarters. In part two, we are signaled that his physical and mental revival is caused by two mundane things: a friend and a meal.

It's been said that fasting can relax the mind, but another perspective I offer you is to treat fasting as getting clearer about what you want. In this case, Rodya initially never wanted to be hungry for days on end, and with this desperation, along with his destitution, his mind focused on its best way out: murder.

Consider part one: Dostoevsky's treatment of this tragic man is slathered with thoughts teetering on sanity's brink. They are emotionally charged and frantic. Even the narrative carries his apathetic confusion for the material world. We read about money given by Rodya to a policeman to help an assaulted girl, then immediately curses himself for doing so, and ultimately curses all money. This brief yet illuminating interaction with his fellow Man exemplifies his Terrible Purpose manifesting itself before the Deed is done. In all these part's pages, he blurts out words in disarray or chokes back his impatience in terse sentences.

Shiting too Part two is where we are reintroduced to just-as-poor yet ardent Razhumikin with his resolute morality; it's his actions that revives the tiny humanity quietly resiing in Rodya before Dostoevksy described him, on page one, as a deviant avoiding his own landlady. Could it be that this friend's Will, based on a sane foundation of morals, is the only one equipped to outmatch Rodya's Will, in its mania? After all, the first time Rodya eats -- and therefore recovers his body's cry for nutrients -- is accomplished by Razhumikin's simple spoon-feeding him like mama to child. 

Accompanying this revival, part two also reveals the choices that Rodya never took to alter his life. The delivery of these revelations is a signature of Dostoevsky's style as he reintroduces the drunkard Marmeladov and presents a nameless girl who makes an attempt on her life. Rodya could've drank himself stupid and thrown himself in front of horse hooves. In his final act of despair, he could've tried to drown himself on the waters below the bridge with that beautiful view of Russian architecture. 

In contrast with the aforementioned duo, Rodya chose more life; yet for someone as deranged, starved as him, he chose the criminal way. Theft is not outright life removal, but his target was so apparently easy, he rationalized escalating the crime in the name of a Philosophy That Benefits All.  These characters remind the reader that the metropolitan brutality of mid-19th century Russian life during these times was shared by more than one. But each has still has a vibrant motive that carries them through to tomorrow.

Yet, you may ask, why bother? Well, there are many more pages in this book, as are many more in the one of your life.

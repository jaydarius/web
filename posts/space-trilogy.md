The praise comes after pointing out some cracks in otherwise masterful storytelling. Book 3 had me until the last 1/8th of the book. The same thing happened for Book 2, but let's focus on the finals stages of _That Hideous Strength_.
Now, Merlin, who strides out of ancient history as a good guy (after all!), becomes supercharged by angels of 5 planets in the solar system. The next paragraph plainly sends him as an infiltrator to Belbury. The sequence srtikes discord: why arm a character with so much might when their next task is in secrecy?

So you expect the spectacular power will be revealed soon enough. But no, we are treated to a banquet of humans where the freed animals take their vengeance on the Prometheans of humanity. It's a witty passage, but Merlin already had the power to talk to animals, so I'm unimpressed. Additionally, this event had a disproportionate amount of coverage than the disquieting looting and destruction of Edgestow (and this was quite well done).

And one other jarring development: we are presented with a final, exhaustive exposition of modern philosophy from the frame of characters' minds whose previously never had their thoughts exposed. Considering the book's pace and initial consistent use of 3rd person narrative through protagonists, isn't it strange to finally start poking into the heads of the antagonists?

Despite all that, it is still splendid in witnessing the struggle of the militant atheist against spiritual powers. Any of the Belbury fellows could be found in your community today. Moreover, the same could be said for the married (and unmarried) men and women who obey the Good with all the emotions of fallen humans.

This trilogy's scope is genius. In guiding the steps of Elwin Ransom for his dear readers, Lewis drew a round-trip that touched on every beloved literary theme starting from the lone man's adventure, where his counterparts were both the catalyst and the evil for his interactions with neutral creatures beyond. Then in Book 2, we are provided a wide space of the feminine's struggle for her essence on a better earth, and how stories are thrashed into the mind at an unfair pace. Finally, Lewis combines the majesty of High Heaven with the human love affair in the mundane college-town of Edgestow, England.

Book 2 gains extra points for the struggle of the two brothers, and generating the scar of the first death on Perelandra to its first killer. This wonderful, dreadful memory persists in Book 3. So, though the faithful follow to this Pendragon, he is still the Christian human who has hated, killed, and lived.
